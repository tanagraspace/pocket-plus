## About

POCKET+ is an European Space Agency (ESA) patented lossless compression algorithm implemented using very low-level instructions such as OR, XOR, AND, etc. It has been designed to run on spacecraft command and control processors with low CPU power available and tight real-time constraints. An earlier version of POCKET+ was flight-proven onboard both the Nanomind 3200 flight computer and SEPP payload computer of ESA's OPS-SAT-1 spacecraft.

The algorithm has been standardized by CCSDS as **CCSDS 124.0-B-1** for compressing fixed-length spacecraft housekeeping packets.

### Which implementation should I use?

**For bare-metal embedded systems**: Use the **C** or **C++** implementation. Both are suitable for resource-constrained systems. The C++ implementation is header-only with template-based size optimization and works with `-fno-exceptions -fno-rtti`. The C implementation is optimized for 32-bit microcontrollers (e.g., GomSpace Nanomind 3200 / AVR32 MCU).

**For payload computers**: Python, Go, Rust, and Java can run on embedded Linux systems such as payload processors (e.g., SEPP on OPS-SAT-1). Choose based on your runtime environment and preference.

**For ground systems and prototyping**: All implementations produce identical compression output. Use whichever language fits your toolchain.

## Quick Start

### Docker (recommended)

Build, test, and generate coverage for any implementation:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm c          # C implementation
docker-compose run --rm cpp        # C++ implementation
docker-compose run --rm python     # Python implementation
docker-compose run --rm go         # Go implementation
docker-compose run --rm rust       # Rust implementation
docker-compose run --rm java       # Java implementation
```

Artifacts are written to `implementations/<lang>/build/`.

### Local Build

cd implementations/c
make          # Build library and CLI
make test     # Run tests
make coverage # Run tests with coverage report
```

#### C++

```bash
cd implementations/cpp
make build    # Build library, CLI, and tests
make test     # Run unit tests
make coverage # Run tests with coverage report
```

#### Python

```bash
cd implementations/python
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest
```

#### Go

```bash
cd implementations/go
make build    # Build library
make test     # Run tests
make coverage # Run tests with coverage
make docs     # Generate documentation
```

#### Rust

```bash
cd implementations/rust
cargo build --release  # Build library and CLI
cargo test             # Run tests
cargo doc --open       # Generate and view documentation
```

#### Java

```bash
cd implementations/java
mvn package            # Build library and CLI
mvn test               # Run tests
mvn javadoc:javadoc    # Generate documentation
```

## Performance

**Key findings** (venus-express dataset, 151K packets, 13.6 MB):
- **C++** is the fastest implementation (~140 MB/s compression, ~146 MB/s decompression), also suitable for embedded systems
- **Java** offers strong performance (~86 MB/s) with JVM convenience
- **Rust** provides good performance (~65 MB/s)
- **C** delivers reliable embedded-friendly performance (~58 MB/s)
- **Go** trades some speed (~49 MB/s) for simplicity and fast compilation

All implementations produce identical compression output. Choose based on your deployment constraints and language ecosystem.

See [Benchmark Results](docs/BENCHMARK.md) for detailed comparison.

### Test Vectors

All vectors are synthetic test data except for venus-express, which contains real housekeeping telemetry from ESA's [Venus Express](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Venus_Express) mission.

| Vector | Packets | Size | R | pt | ft | rt |
|--------|---------|------|---|----|----|-----|
| simple | 100 | 9 KB | 1 | 10 | 20 | 50 |
| hiro | 100 | 9 KB | 7 | 10 | 20 | 50 |
| housekeeping | 10,000 | 900 KB | 2 | 20 | 50 | 100 |
| venus-express | 151,200 | 13.6 MB | 2 | 20 | 50 | 100 |

### Run Benchmarks

```bash
docker-compose run --rm benchmark
```
