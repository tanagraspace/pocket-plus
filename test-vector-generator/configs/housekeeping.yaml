# Housekeeping Synthetic Test Vector
# Realistic spacecraft housekeeping telemetry patterns

name: housekeeping
description: |
  Synthetic test vector simulating realistic spacecraft housekeeping data.
  Includes typical patterns: stable parameters, slow-changing sensors,
  counters, and status flags.

# Input configuration
input:
  type: synthetic
  packet_length: 90  # bytes
  num_packets: 10000
  seed: 1337  # Fixed seed for reproducibility

# Compression parameters (typical spacecraft settings)
compression:
  packet_length: 90
  pt: 20  # Track changes every 20 packets
  ft: 50  # Full mask every 50 packets
  rt: 100 # Full packet every 100 packets
  robustness: 2

# Expected outcomes
expected:
  compression_ratio_min: 7.0
  compression_ratio_max: 10.0
  compression_ratio_typical: 8.5
