# Edge Cases Test Vector
# Boundary values and aggressive compression parameters

name: edge-cases
description: |
  Synthetic test vector with mixed stable/changing sections.
  - Bytes 0-29: Completely stable (0x00)
  - Bytes 30-59: Step-wise incrementing (0→95, +5 every 25 packets)
  - Bytes 60-89: Completely stable (0xFF)

  Tests the algorithm's efficiency with partial packet changes - only 1/3 of each
  packet changes while the rest remains stable. This is different from 'simple'
  which has more varied patterns throughout the packet.

# Input configuration
input:
  type: synthetic
  packet_length: 90  # bytes
  num_packets: 500
  seed: 9999  # Fixed seed for reproducibility

# Compression parameters (same as simple, for compatibility)
compression:
  packet_length: 90
  pt: 10  # Frequent tracking
  ft: 20  # Frequent full mask
  rt: 50  # Frequent full packet
  robustness: 1  # Standard robustness

# Expected outcomes (excellent compression with very stable patterns)
expected:
  compression_ratio_min: 12.0
  compression_ratio_max: 18.0
  compression_ratio_typical: 15.0

# Output configuration

  input_file: edge-cases.bin
  compressed_file: edge-cases.bin.pkt
  decompressed_file: edge-cases.bin.pkt.depkt
